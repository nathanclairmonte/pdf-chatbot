# PDF ChatBot ðŸ“„ðŸ¤–

## Overview

This is the repo for my PDF ChatBot application, an extension of my [ArXiv ChatBot Application](https://github.com/nathanclairmonte/arxiv-bot-ui). This application extends on the ArXiv ChatBot by allowing users to upload their own PDF files to chat with. This functionality is facilitated using [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) buckets.

To be able to upload local PDFs, users must first sign in and have their account approved. At a base-level this was just to keep usage at a reasonable level and protect my Amazon credits, but it also allowed me to play around with various authentication methods for Next.js applications.

However, I've included functionality to chat with pre-existing sample PDFs for users who just want to test out the functionality of the app without signing in.

## Tech Stack

This application is powered by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs) and therefore uses [React](https://react.dev/) on the frontend. On the backend, [LangChain JS](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchainjs/), [Next.js API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) and [Amazon S3 buckets](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) are used to handle document loading and question answering over a document. To handle user authentication, [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/) is used with a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database.
